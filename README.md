Problem Statement: 
Enhanced Urban Cooling with Predictive Air Quality Management and Carbon Sequestration

Executive Summary:
Urban areas are facing increasing challenges with rising temperatures and air pollution, contributing to a host of health problems. In response to this, our initiative focuses on quantifying Carbon Sequestration and optimizing Urban Cooling through comprehensive Air Quality analysis and prediction. By leveraging advanced models such as ARIMA and CatBoost, we aim to identify optimal cooling locations, providing a data-driven approach to urban planning. This report outlines our methodology, findings, and the potential impact of our proposed policies, aligning with the Tamil Nadu Urban Cooling Programme 2023.
